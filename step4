Part 4: Master Setup & Deployment Guide

We break the process into eight major sections:

    1) GitHub Setup
    2) Local/Test Environment
    3) AWS Services & Production Environment
    4) NGINX Configuration
    5) Tor Hidden Service Setup
    6) AWS S3 Storage Buckets
    7) Final Checklist (Django + RN)
    8) Terms & Conditions / Usage Policy

Follow each step in order.
1) GitHub Setup

    Create a New Repository:
        Go to github.com and sign in or create an account.
        Click “New” to create a repository named, for example, ghost-protocol.
        Choose “Private” or “Public” depending on your preference.

    Initialize:
        On your local machine, open a terminal in your ghost_protocol/ folder (the Django backend).
        Run:

        git init
        git remote add origin https://github.com/<YourUsername>/ghost-protocol.git
        git add .
        git commit -m "Initial commit"
        git push origin master

        Do the same for your React Native project (GhostProtocolApp/) if you want a separate repo or subfolder.

    Set Up Branches:
        Optionally create a dev branch for your local tests.
        Merging changes from dev to main ensures a stable code on main.

    Enable GitHub Actions (Optional CI/CD):
        Go to “Actions” tab in your repo, set up a basic Python workflow for the Django code or a React Native workflow.
        This helps run automated tests on push events, ensuring code quality.

2) Local/Test Environment
2.1. Local Docker-Based Setup (Recommended)

    Install Docker & Docker Compose:
        On docker.com, download for your OS.
        Ensure docker-compose is installed.

    In the ghost_protocol/backend/ folder, you should have a docker-compose.yml. Example snippet:

version: '3.9'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    command: daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 ghost_protocol.channelsrouting:application
    volumes:
      - .:/app
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    depends_on:
      - redis
      - db
  redis:
    image: redis:latest
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
  db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_DB=ghostprotocol_db
      - POSTGRES_USER=ghostprotocol_user
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ghostprotocol_pass
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
volumes:
  postgres_data:

(Your actual file might differ; this is just a typical example.)

Run:

cd ghost_protocol/backend
docker-compose up --build

Docker will pull Redis/Postgres, build your Django image, and run it at localhost:8000.

Migrate & Create Superuser:
Inside the web container, run:

    docker-compose exec web python manage.py migrate
    docker-compose exec web python manage.py createsuperuser

2.2. Local Testing of React Native**

    Install Node.js (v16 or above).

    Install Android Studio or Xcode if on macOS for iOS.

    In the React Native folder (GhostProtocolApp):

    yarn install
    npx react-native start
    npx react-native run-android
    # or
    npx react-native run-ios

    API Base URL:
        By default, set API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000 in your .env (or react-native-config) for local dev.

    Confirm ephemeral chat, blocking, archived logic, etc. all work in your emulator.

3) AWS Services & Production Environment

We’ll outline the recommended approach:
3.1. AWS EC2 / Elastic Beanstalk for Django + Channels

    Create an EC2 Instance (Ubuntu 22.04) or use Elastic Beanstalk with a Docker environment:
        In the AWS Console, pick “EC2,” launch an instance with a T3 or T4 micro for testing.
        For real scaling, a bigger instance or ECS/EKS might be used.

    Install dependencies:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip postgresql-client redis-server
# or rely on AWS ElastiCache for Redis, AWS RDS for Postgres

Clone your GitHub repo:

git clone https://github.com/<YourUsername>/ghost-protocol.git

Set Up Python Virtual Env:

cd ghost-protocol/backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Set Env Vars in ~/.bashrc or an .env file:

export SECRET_KEY="YOURSECRET"
export DEBUG=False
export ALLOWED_HOSTS="yourdomain.com"
export POSTGRES_HOST="yourdb.xxxx.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com"
# etc

Run Migrations & Create Superuser:

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser

Run a production server:

    pip install gunicorn uvicorn
    # For channels:
    daphne ghost_protocol.channelsrouting:application --port 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0

    Or use supervisor/systemd to keep it running.

3.2. AWS RDS (Postgres) & ElastiCache (Redis)

    Create an RDS instance for your database.
    Create an ElastiCache Redis cluster.
    Update your settings.py with the new DB host & Redis config.

3.3. AWS ECS or EKS (Alternative)

    If you prefer container-based or Kubernetes, push your Docker image to ECR, then run in ECS/EKS with Fargate.
    Configure environment variables in ECS Task definitions.

4) NGINX Configuration

For a typical Channels deployment, you might place NGINX in front of daphne or uvicorn. Example:

File: /etc/nginx/sites-available/ghost_protocol.conf

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location /static/ {
        alias /home/ubuntu/ghost_protocol/backend/staticfiles/;
    }

    location /media/ {
        alias /home/ubuntu/ghost_protocol/backend/media/;
    }

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}

Then:

sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/ghost_protocol.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo service nginx restart

(For HTTPS, add a Certbot config or an ACM certificate if behind AWS Load Balancer. Also ensure you proxy WebSocket requests with proxy_http_version 1.1.)
5) Tor Hidden Service Setup

To run a .onion address:

    Install Tor:

sudo apt-get install tor

Edit /etc/tor/torrc:

HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ghost_protocol/
HiddenServicePort 80 127.0.0.1:8000

Or if you want SSL on 443, do HiddenServicePort 443 127.0.0.1:8000.
Restart Tor:

    sudo service tor restart

    Find your .onion in /var/lib/tor/ghost_protocol/hostname.
    Access http://<onionaddress>.onion from Tor Browser.

(No placeholders. You must ensure your NGINX or daphne listens on 127.0.0.1 so Tor can forward to it.)
6) AWS S3 Storage Buckets

If you use AWS S3 to store ephemeral attachments:

    Create an S3 Bucket:
        In AWS Console, “S3,” create a new bucket named “ghostprotocol-bucket.”
        Region: US East (N. Virginia) typically.

    IAM User:
        Create an IAM user with programmatic access, attach an S3 policy.
        Store AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY in your environment variables.

    Django:
        Install boto3 if not included.
        In settings.py, reference AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, etc.
        If you want direct usage, you can store ephemeral attachments in S3 by overriding FileField with a custom storage backend.

    Confirm ephemeral logic with Celery tasks removing old files from S3 as needed.

7) Final Checklist (Django + RN)

    Check .env & environment variables for both.
    Database: connected & migrated.
    Redis: running for ephemeral tasks & Channels.
    Nginx: configured for reverse proxy & WebSockets.
    Tor: hidden service is up if you want .onion access.
    React Native: API_BASE_URL points to your domain or onion.
    Test ephemeral chat, blocks, archived counters, calls, etc. thoroughly.

8) Terms & Conditions / Usage Policy
